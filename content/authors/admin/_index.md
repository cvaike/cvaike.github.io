I'm an experienced Lecturer in Finance with a demonstrated history of conducting academic research in the field of corporate finance. I've created this personal website in response to the Covid-19 community transmissions in Honiara and other provinces. This platform aims to provide an online option for my students who may have contracted the virus or are geographically isolated and are unable to be physically present in the classroom. Here students will get access to all my lecturers and teaching materials they need in order to successfully complete a course.
